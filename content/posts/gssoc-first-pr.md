Through this PR, I got the opportunity to implement the UI design for the popups in flutter that would then be used in various other parts of the application.

As the work progressed, in order to accommodate changes due to upcoming needs, refactoring was done and it finally ended up in the work tree hierarchy shown below.

## Challenges Encountered

While building the PopupState widget, we made use of the ListTile widget, and came across the fact that a subtitle may not be preferred with every title, and hence ended up making that property nullable, and used an empty string as a fallback, if no argument was passed against the popupSubtitle parameter.

```java
ListTile(
    title: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 8),
        child: Text(
            popupTitle,
            style: const TextStyle(
                fontFamily: 'Lexend',
                fontSize: 20,
            ),
            textAlign: TextAlign.center,
        ),
    ),
    subtitle: Text(
        popupSubtitle ?? '',
        textAlign: TextAlign.center,
    ),
);
```

But as a result, if the popupSubtitle did turn out to be null, in the UI, the ListTile would reserve some space for the subtitle, which would appear as a prominent gap, as in the below snip.

## Proposed Solution

The solution to this was to introduce a function that, based on the value of subtitle, would decide whether to return null or the subtitle wrapped inside the Text widget. The following snippet illustrates the solution.

```java
Widget? _judgeSubtitle() {
    return popupSubtitle == null
        ? null
        : Text(
            popupSubtitle!,
            textAlign: TextAlign.center,
          );
}
```

And, the complete code would then look like,

```java
ListTile(
    title: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 8),
        child: Text(
            popupTitle,
            style: const TextStyle(
                fontFamily: 'Lexend',
                fontSize: 20,
            ),
            textAlign: TextAlign.center,
        ),
    ),
    subtitle: _judgeSubtitle(),
);
```

Ultimately, the ListTile no longer reserves space for the subtitle and the output looks as desired.
